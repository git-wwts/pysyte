The imports module
==================

    >>> from pysyte import imports
    >>> assert "Import imports" in imports.__doc__

Parse imports
-------------

Given a python file
    >>> python_file = imports.__file__

We can parse its imports

    >>> python_imports = imports.parse(python_file)
    >>> assert python_imports

And expect that `imports` will import importlib
    >>> assert "importlib" in python_imports.imports
