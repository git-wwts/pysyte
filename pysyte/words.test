The words module
================

    >>> from pysyte import words
    >>> assert 'English words' in words.__doc__

Plurals
-------

Can find plurals of words
    >>> assert words.pluralize('fred') == 'freds'

Which preserves case
    >>> assert words.pluralize('Freddy') == 'Freddies'

Singulars
---------

We can also get singular forms,
    but the method is called words.depluralize to emphasize that
    it just does the opposite of words.pluralize()

ONe gets less milk from only one of these
    >>> assert words.depluralize('cows') == 'cow'

But there's still plenty of sailing at the only one of these
    >>> assert words.depluralize('Cowes') == 'Cowes'


Names for numbers
-----------------

    >>> assert words.number_name(-621.77) == 'minus six hundred and twenty one point seven seven'
